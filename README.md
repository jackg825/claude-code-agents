## Agent Definition Format

Each agent follows a standardized format with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Unique identifier
description: Brief description...   # What the agent does
tools: file_edit, bash, file_search # Available tools
triggers:                          # Proactive activation patterns
  - "error"
  - "bug"
  - "test failure"
proactive: true                    # Can activate automatically
---

# Agent Name

## Role: [Professional Title]

### Mission
[Core purpose and value proposition]

### Core Competencies
- [Skill 1]
- [Skill 2]
...

## Workflow
[Detailed operational procedures]

## Best Practices
[Guidelines and standards]
```

## Adding Agents to Claude Code

### Step 1: Understanding Integration
Claude Code recognizes agents through the `@agent-name` syntax. When you reference an agent, Claude Code:
1. Loads the agent's definition and context
2. Adopts the agent's specialized behavior
3. Uses only the specified tools
4. Follows the defined workflows

### Step 2: Installing Agents
There are several ways to add agents to your Claude Code workflow:

#### Option A: Direct Reference
Simply copy the agent definition content and reference it in your conversation:
```
Please act as @strategic-planner and help me design a payment system
```

#### Option B: Project Integration
1. Copy agent definitions to your project
2. Create a `/agents` or `/personas` directory
3. Reference agents in your CLAUDE.md file
4. Use agents throughout development

#### Option C: Global Configuration
Add frequently used agents to your global Claude configuration:
1. Access Claude Code settings
2. Add agent definitions to your workspace
3. Agents become available across all projects

### Step 3: Best Practices for Agent Usage
- **One Agent at a Time**: Activate one agent per task for clarity
- **Clear Handoffs**: Explicitly transition between agents
- **Respect Boundaries**: Don't ask agents to work outside their expertise
- **Provide Context**: Give agents necessary background information

## Creating Your Own Agents

### Step 1: Identify the Need
Ask yourself:
- What repetitive tasks could be specialized?
- What expertise is needed frequently?
- Where do mistakes commonly occur?
- What workflows could be standardized?

### Step 2: Define the Agent
Create a new file in `/personas/your-agent.md`:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent
description: What this agent specializes in
tools: [appropriate tools]
triggers: [activation patterns]
proactive: false
---

# Your Agent Name

## Role: [Title]

### Mission
[What value this agent provides]

### Core Competencies
- [Specific skills]

## Workflow
[Step-by-step procedures]
```

### Step 3: Choose Appropriate Tools
Select from available Claude Code tools:
- `file_edit`: For code modifications
- `file_search`: For codebase exploration
- `bash`: For command execution
- `web_search`: For research
- `file_read`: For analysis

### Step 4: Test and Iterate
1. Test the agent in real scenarios
2. Refine workflows based on results
3. Add error handling procedures
4. Document edge cases

### Step 5: Share and Improve
- Submit PRs with new agents
- Share successful patterns
- Document lessons learned

## Agent Collaboration

Agents work together in a coordinated workflow:

1. **Steering Architect** establishes project foundation
2. **LLMs.txt Generator** creates concise project summary
3. **Product Manager** defines what to build
4. **Strategic Planner** designs how to build it
5. **Task Executor** implements the solution
6. **Code Reviewer** ensures quality
7. **Debugger** resolves issues
8. **Data Scientist** provides insights

## Key Features

### Proactive Activation
Agents can activate automatically based on triggers:
- Code changes trigger review
- Errors trigger debugging
- New requirements trigger planning

### Autonomous Mode
Task executor supports autonomous operation:
- Continues through task lists
- Skips manual verification steps
- Only stops for blocking errors

### Quality Standards
All agents enforce:
- Code quality and security
- Testing requirements
- Documentation standards
- Performance optimization

## Integration with Claude Code

### Performance Tips
1. **Context Management**: Use llms.txt to reduce context usage
2. **Agent Focus**: One agent = one responsibility
3. **Clear Communication**: Explicit agent invocation
4. **Workflow Efficiency**: Follow established patterns

### Common Patterns
```bash
# Start new project
@steering-architect analyze this codebase
@llms-txt-generator create project summary

# Add new feature
@product-manager create PRD for user notifications
@strategic-planner design notification system
@task-executor implement notifications

# Fix production issue
@debugger investigate API timeout errors
@task-executor apply performance fix
@code-reviewer verify the solution
```

### Debugging Agents
If an agent isn't working as expected:
1. Check the agent definition syntax
2. Verify tool availability
3. Ensure clear invocation
4. Review context requirements

## Best Practices

### 1. Use the Right Agent
Each agent is optimized for specific tasks. Don't use:
- Strategic Planner for coding
- Task Executor for planning
- Code Reviewer for implementation

### 2. Follow the Workflow
The framework is designed for sequential phases:
- Plan before implementing
- Review after coding
- Debug when issues arise

### 3. Maintain Documentation
Keep project docs current:
- Update `.docs/` as project evolves
- Complete specs before implementation
- Document decisions and learnings
- Refresh llms.txt periodically

### 4. Leverage Automation
Use autonomous features when appropriate:
- Batch similar tasks
- Enable autonomous execution
- Set up proactive triggers

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Existing Project)
```bash
# 1. Initialize project understanding
@steering-architect analyze codebase and create project docs

# 2. Create project summary
@llms-txt-generator create llms.txt for this project

# 3. Plan your first feature
@strategic-planner plan [your-feature-name]

# 4. Execute implementation
@task-executor execute specs/[your-feature-name]/tasks.md

# 5. Ensure quality
@code-reviewer review recent changes
```

### New Project Setup
```bash
